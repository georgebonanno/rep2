Task 1:


The R scripts mentioned in this section make use of the following libraries.
	SQLite
	stringr
	RcolorBrewer
	ggplot2

These packages can be installed using the following statement:
	install.packages(c("RSQLite", "stringr”, ”RcolorBrewer",”ggplot2”))


*** The following text assumes that the current working 
	directory is 'task1' ***

Note: The pgn files can be loaded into an sqlite database under (db/chess.db)
	  by running ./loadChessData.sh *.pgn. This will take a lot of time. The 
	  information extracted from the database already been loaded and supplied
	  in the .RData file.

The visualisation can be generated by running
	R -f chessVisualisation.R

Task 2:

The R scripts mentioned in this section make use of the following libraries.
	caret
	e1071
	ggmap
	ggplot2
	reshape2
	rvest
	stringdist
	stringi
	stringr
	tm

These packages can be installed using the following statement:
install.packages(c("caret","e1071","ggmap",
			"ggplot2","reshape2","rvest",
			"stringdist","stringi,
			"stringr","tm")) 

*** The following text assumes that the current working 
	directory is 'task2' ***

Note: The feature extraction, data cleaning and duplicate removal is achieved
	 by the script ./extractPropertiesToCsv.sh. This assumes that the html files
	 are in a 'data' directory. However, the csv file outputted from this script
	 have already been generated for use by the subsequent sub tasks.


a)	The csv loaded, outlier removal and imputation is done using
	
		R --save -f csvProcessing.R

b) 	Visualisations can be viewed by using the following statement. Whilst
	viewing 

	R --save -f visualizations.R
	R --save -f geoLocation.R
	R --save -f advertismentsDates.R

c)	The statistcal analysis can be run using:

	R -f statisticalAnaylsis.R

d)	The prediction model can be run using:

	R -f predictiveModel.R
